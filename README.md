2. Optional: test locally with `pelican -s dev-settings.py -o /path/to/output`.
3. Push your commits to GitHub.
4. Ask for feedback via a pull request (`dev` -> `master`).
5. Incorporate feedback.
6. Update the post date.

### Generate output

1. Generate output locally with `pelican -s settings.py`. Files will be updated in the `output` folder.
2. Verify the output in your browser.
3. Push your commits to GitHub (these will be included in the open pull request).
4. Accept the pull request to `master`.
