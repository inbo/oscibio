[LifeWatch](https://www.lifewatch.be/) and [Elixir Belgium](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/) invite you to a hands-on workshop to manage and publish research data. The workshop is organized in the context of the [Empowering Biodiversity Research conference](https://www.biodiversity.be/4443) and will cover data management plans, data cleaning and GitHub. If this is jargon you always wanted to know about (but were afraid to ask), then this workshop is for you!

## Who

This workshop is aimed at environmental and life scientists that manage research data, from PhD students to senior scientists. It is an introductory workshop to data management, data cleaning and data publishing. We recommend participants to have a basic understanding of R and its data types. We can send resources for people who need an introduction to R before this workshop. The level of this workshop is from beginner to intermediate, we will not cover advanced materials.
