We just released a new version (0.4.0) of our R package **camtrapdp**.

With camtrapdp you can read and manipulate Camera Trap Data Packages (Camtrap DP). [Camtrap DP](https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org) is a data exchange format for camera trap data. The R package supports reading, filtering and transforming data (including to [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org)) before further analysis in e.g.Â [camtraptor](https://inbo.github.io/camtraptor/) or [camtrapR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=camtrapR).

## What has changed?

We added two long-requested functions:

- [`write_camtrapdp()`](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/write_camtrapdp.html) to write a Camtrap DP dataset to disk.
- [`merge_camtrapdp()`](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/merge_camtrapdp.html) to merge two datasets, allowing you to combine data from multiple studies.

We also added new functions to:

- Update (or clean) data: [`round_coordinates()`](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/round_coordinates.html), [`shift_time()`](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/shift_time.html), [`update_taxon()`](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/update_taxon.html).
- Extract data: [`contributors()`](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/contributors.html), [`individuals()`](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/individuals.html).

The Darwin Core processing was also improved, allowing [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) to ingest Camtrap DP datasets. This includes a new function [`write_eml()`](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/write_eml.html) to better populate dataset landing pages with metadata.

For a full overview of all the changes, see the [CHANGELOG](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/news/index.html#camtrapdp-040).
