UPDATE

[GloBAM](https://globam.science) is a research project funded by [BiodivERsA](https://www.biodiversa.org) with partners from Switzerland, Finland, the Netherlands, the UK, the US and our team from Belgium (funded by [BELSPO](https://www.belspo.be)). Its objectives are to monitor the aerial migrations of animals (birds, insects and bats) using weather radar networks, understand global patterns in the intensity, routes and timing of aerial migrations, and to forecast how these migrations are likely to respond to global change.

What we do: coordinating data management, setting up a data infrastructure, and developing research software to access and analyze these data.

## LIFE RIPARIAS

[LIFE RIPARIAS](https://www.riparias.be) is a LIFE-funded project that aims to optimize the management of invasive alien species (IAS) in rivers and ponds. By developing an innovative evidence-based workflow, the project will inform decision-makers and managers of the most effective and cost efficient management actions to successfully control the most problematic species.

What we do: developing an early warning system for invasive plants and crayfish species, fed by rapidly and openly published IAS occurrence data. We will also develop a reporting system for management actions, using standardized and quantifiable variables.

## LifeWatch

[LifeWatch Belgium](http://www.lifewatch.be) is part of [LifeWatch ERIC](https://www.lifewatch.eu/), a European infrastructure for biodiversity research. LifeWatch was established as part of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructure ([ESFRI](http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri)) and became a European Research Infrastructure consortium (ERIC) in 2017. Belgium contributes to LifeWatch ERIC with initiatives from Flanders, Wallonia-Brussels and the federal state. The [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo/en-gb/) and the [Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ)](http://www.vliz.be/en) are cooperating in the Flemish LifeWatch project, funded by the [Research foundation - Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/en/).

What we do: setting up sensor networks, the publication of biodiversity data, and the development of research software. Our sensor networks include GPS trackers for large birds, an acoustic receiver network for fish, camera traps, groundwater sensors, and climate monitoring. We support researchers from (international) universities and research institutes by publishing open data, building software packages to query and analyze these data and organizing workshops.
