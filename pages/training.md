## Checklist recipe

The checklist recipe is a template GitHub repository for standardizing thematic species checklist data to Darwin Core using R. It contains all the ingredients to make data standardization open, repeatable, customizable and documented. The checklist recipe won the [2018 GBIF Ebbe Nielsen Challenge](https://www.gbif.org/news/4TuHBNfycgO4GEMOKkMi4u/six-winners-top-the-2018-ebbe-nielsen-challenge). We use it ourselves for the [TrIAS](http://www.trias-project.be/) and [LIFE RIPARIAS](https://www.riparias.be/) projects.
