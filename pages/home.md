üëã We are the Open science lab for biodiversity, an externally funded team at the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo/en-gb/). We aim to make biodiversity research open and reproducible.

We offer technical support to the [research projects](/projects/) we participate in, e.g. the Belgian Biodiversity Platform, LifeWatch, TrIAS and GloBAM. Our support is mainly focused on data management, [open data publication](/datasets/) and [research software development](/packages/). We ‚ù§Ô∏è open science, so our approach is open by default, international and community-oriented.

Interested to work with us? Get in touch.
