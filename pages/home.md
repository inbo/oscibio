👋 We are the Open science lab for biodiversity, an externally funded team at the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.inbo.be/en). We aim to make biodiversity research open and reproducible.

We offer technical support to the research projects we participate in, e.g. the Belgian Biodiversity Platform, LifeWatch, TrIAS and GloBAM. Our support is mainly focused on data management, [open data publication](/datasets/) and [research software development](/packages/). We ❤️ open science, so our approach is open by default, international and community-oriented.

Interested to work with us? Get in touch.
