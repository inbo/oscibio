üëã We are the Open science lab for biodiversity, a project-funded team at the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo/en-gb/) in Belgium. We make biodiversity research open and reproducible through data, standards and software.

We offer technical support to the [research projects](/projects/) we participate in, such as B-Cubed, BIG_PICTURE, DTO-BioFlow, GuardIAS, HiRAD, LIFE RIPARIAS, LifeWatch, OneSTOP. Our support is mainly focused on data management, [open data publication](/datasets/) and [research software development](/packages/). We ‚ù§Ô∏è open science, so our approach is open by default, international and community-oriented.
